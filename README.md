Add dataset `database-accuracy.csv` from LCDB into the `lcdb` folder

To run all experiments use:

`
python main.py
`

The files conatian the following:

* experiment_1.py - Convexity estimation for learning curves

* experiment_2.py - Convexity estimation for individual learning curves

* experiment_3.py - Confidence interval calculation of the anchors

* base_lines.py - Generates the baselines

* evaluation.py - processes the results from the experiments

* convexity_check.py - File containing the algorithms used in the experiments

Results are saved into the 'results' folder
